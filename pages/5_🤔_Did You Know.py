    1. Roughly one-third of the food produced that is intended for human consumption every year- around 1.3 billion tons and valued at USD$1 trillion- is wasted or lost. This is enough to feed 3 billion people. 
    2. Food waste ends up wasting a quarter of our water supply in the form of uneaten food. Thatâ€™s equated to USD$172billion in wasted water.
    3. Taking into account all the resources used to grow food, food waste uses up to 21% of freshwater, 19% of fertilisers, 18% of cropland, and 21% of landfill volume.
    4. The water used to produce the food wasted could be used by 9 billion people at around 200 litres per person per day. 
    5. The food currently wasted in Europe could feed 200 million people, in Latin America 300 million people, and in Africa 300 million people. 
    6. Annual per capita waste by consumers is between 95-115 kiograms a year for Europeans and North Americans, while in the south and southeastern Asia, it is 6-11kgs. 
    7. Food loss and waste account for about 4.4 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. 
    8. If food loss was a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and the US.
    9. Breaking it down by food group, losses, and waste per year are roughly 30% for cereals, 40-50% for root crops and fruit and vegetables, 20% for oil seed and meat and dairy, and 35% for fish.
